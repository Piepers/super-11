# super-11

An application that attempts to get as much football data as accurately as possible. This data is then used to allow 
users to create a team of players that they score points with based on actual events in the match. 

Ultimately it must be possible to let users invite other people to a league where they can decide which rules apply for 
a season. All kinds of possibilities come to mind like selecting one player per team of a certain league and let them
gather points for teams. Or rules where one player of any football league in Europe must form a team with which points
are gathered. More and more possibilities will be worked out as time progresses. 

This application is a Vert.x application. This Readme will be updated with instructions how to start and use it.
